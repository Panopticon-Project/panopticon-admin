## Milestone: Define intelligence analysis framework
Currently there exists a number of intelligence analysis frameworks. They need to be evaluated to ensure they will meet the requirements of P2 and then one needs to be chosen. If an off the shelf framework can't be found that meets all of P2's requirements, a new one will need to be defined.

## Milestone: Lauch
Complete the [Mozilla Open Leaders Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series) to ensure the respository is ready to receive contributions

## Milestone: Outreach
To draw contributors to P2 stories will need to be pitched to news outlets
