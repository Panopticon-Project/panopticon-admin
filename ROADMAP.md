# Panopticon Project Road Map

## Mission Statement and Summary
P2 is an open source database of open source intelligence (OSINT) covering the electronic capabilities of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), nation states, and corporations that exercise nation state capabilities.

## Ongoing issues
[Launch project](https://github.com/Panopticon-Project/panopticon-admin/projects/1)

## Milestone: Complete the Admin repo

## Milestone: Complete the Tools repo

## Milestone: Define intelligence analysis framework
Currently there exists a number of intelligence analysis frameworks. They need to be evaluated to ensure they will meet the requirements of P2 and then one needs to be chosen. If an off the shelf framework can't be found that meets all of P2's requirements, a new one will need to be defined.

## Milestone: Complete the analysis on one repository for reference
By completing the analysis for one respository people can see how the framework is applied in a practical sense and should have less of a barrier to contributing.

## Milestone: Lauch
Complete the [Mozilla Open Leaders Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series) to ensure the respository is ready to receive contributions

## Milestone: Outreach
To draw contributors to P2 stories will need to be pitched to news outlets
