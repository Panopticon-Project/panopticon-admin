This is one person's quest to understand the world we live in

This project's connection to the idea of the open web
this is not about non-proprietary web technologies, though it might create some. not about web standards, though could be about their security, understanding them and seeing how they can be turned against you
[Open Web](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/getting-to-know-mozilla-and-the-leadership-network/) can just be looked at as web standards, publishing and accessing content, but like the panopticon this soulless. Putting the open web in human context it's about: 

    Inclusion: an accessible, free Internet for all - who is being targeted, these are marginalised groups. If you're being targeted you aren't free to use the internet safely, also surveullance
    Privacy: user control of their own data on the web - if our data is being used to target us we don't have privacy, also surveillance
    [Web literacy](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/): the ability for everyone to meaningfully
        Read: navigate the web, and find, evaluate, and synthesize web content - need to know who is watching what you read, need a safe environment to explore, find the kind of information contained in these repos, critically assess them
        Write: code, design, compose, revise and remix content for the web - work on code, write analysis, fork our stuff, do stuff with with to change the world
        Participate: connect with online communities, share, contribute, maintain control over their own personal data, and work collaboratively with others on the web. - connect with security researchers and privacy advocates, if you want to use the internet safely these are the people you want to know.
        
Looking at this kind of stuff is a good primer to the wild west of the internet.
