# Panopticon Project

## Welcome
Thank you for checking out Panopticon Project (P2)! 

## What is Panopticon Project?
P2 is an open source database of open source intelligence (OSINT) covering the electronic capabilities of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), nation states, and corporations that exercise nation state capabilites. 

That was a lot of open source so let's break that down quickly. [Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) is anything that allows people to add to it, collaborate on it, take it, do their own thing with it. It's the opposite of [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary), which denotes ownership. We often see the terms open source and proprietary in relation to software, meaning software that anyone can add to the codebase of, like Linux, and software you can't add to the code base of because it is under copyright, namely Windows and Mac. But as you can see, open source can also apply to things like troves information and even information gathering techniques. [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) refers to the gathering of information in the public domain that anyone can do.

## Why does Panopticon Project exist?
P2 exists, in short, because the world we all live in has become a dystopia. 

State sponsored hackers are infiltrating critical infrastruture, so far having proven their ability cause [blackouts](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine). Liberal Western democracies are the most intrusive [surviellance states](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/) in history. Corporations [collect information on their users](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/why-googles-spying-on-use_b_3530296.html) without their knowledge or consent. In the not too distant past this was science fiction, now it is our reality. For many of us it is not a reality we desire. 

Yet, few understand how bad reality has gotten, and that suits those who have made this our reality just fine. However there is a great deal of information lying in the public domain that can be used to learn about the powers behind our dystopia. By informing ourselves we can make informed decisions about how we interact with the world, from the political movements we interact with through to the services we use and the products we buy. By contributing to projects like P2, you can also learn how to better access information in the public domain and train yourself on how to keep a critical eye on the powers that be. From checking facts to some [OSINT sleuthing of your own](http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/exclusive-indian-it-guru-linked-to-fake-wmc-sites-20170726), P2 empowers you to interact in a more informed manner with the world.

## Who can contributes to P2?
Anyone with an internet connection and basic reading abilities.

## How can I get involved?
Check out our contributing guidelines.

## What does P2 need?
Eyes and time. For the most part we need people to look for news articles, declassified and leaked files now in the public domain, threat intelligence reports from cyber security companies, the list goes on. Then they need to be read and verified where possible. Anyone can contribute to this.

Those of you with visual arts abilities, we need a website and promotional material.

If you happen to have technical skills, even basic technical skills, there are more advanced ways for you to contribute. See our contributing guide for more details.

## I want to get in touch with P2
insert email address here.

## I want to leak something to P2

Seriously, just don't. This project is not equipped to handle leaked material not already in the public domain. Do your research and find a reputable news outlet that has a proven track record in handling leaked material in a reponsible and safe manner.

## P2 is a terrible idea, you're helping terrorists!

And to that list you could add organised crime, hostile foreign governments, even your actual government if it isn't terribly sophisticated and doesn't already know this themselves. I would say firstly, this is a compilation of intelligence from publiclly avalable channels, at no point was any law broken. But the bigger point here is that there are plenty of entities that help terrorists, organised crime, governments etc., at a scale this database never could. One of them is gun manufacturers, and there are plenty others so you have bigger problems than P2.

To specifically address the point about terrorism, and this feeds into the wider debate about encryption and national security, it's true a terrorist could use P2 to assist them in comitting an act of violence. Again though, everthing in P2 is compiled from online sources so if P2 didn't exist that assistance was still there to be found, nothing new has been provided. The basic argument for privacy, and this comes back to terrorism, is curtains or blinds on your windows don't make you a criminal, it just means you want privacy. It's a part of human nature to want to express ourselves with no one, or those close, rather than an unchosen party or indeed the whole world. We need to be able to express ourselves and not all of humanity is pretty. That's not to say the ugly elements should be accepted, but sometimes people want to express them and its important they do in environments where there are a lot of moderate voices that through social mechanisms of a community dissuade the person from those ugly views. 

We've all held a view at some point in our lives that was repugnant to someone and what probably happened is we matured and grew out of it either by interacting with others and passively conclusing ourselves that view is socially unacceptable, examining why its unacceptable and internalising that conclusion, or being actively told "that's not cool!" I want disaffected youths to find encryption tools so they can find safe spaces, free of government surveillance, where they can express themselves and the community can fill those spaces with moderate voices. If encryption is cracked down upon these people are either 1. going to feel repressed because there is no safe space for them to express themselves and those ideas may not be moderated out through community interaction, or 2. they will go looking for safe spaces and if the moderate community can't provide one, hardened extremists will. Once one of these two things have happened radicalisation has started and its virtually game over because time and again we see police and intelligence agencies don't have the resources to investigate every name that comes across their desk. Figures differ but it's often quoted you need between ten and thirty people for round the clock surviellance of one target. Through sheer math some terrorist attacks will be successful. You need to prevent either 1 or 2 from happening.

We can all take a leaf from Hunuism, or [Ubuntu](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/p/index.php?title=Ubuntu_(philosophy)), a belief held by many southern African tribes that roughly translates into English as "I exist through community and community exists through me." Even the most stauch individualist will concede that while they may not be typical of the norm, we humans are by and large social creatures. Community has been regulating itself since the dawn of time, and while community must not become tyranny, people must not infringe upon others, which is how repugnance is defined above. [Surveillance is corrosive to privacy and community](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/the-surveillance-state-is-corrosive-the-case-of-pamela-jones/278846/) to quote the common phrase. We need privacy, becasue it's the bedrock of community, and we need community because it's the bulwark aganist extremism.

Bottom line, for all you critics out there, Panopticon Project is actually a deradicalisation tool.

## The story behind Panopticon Project

Once done http://splasho.com/upgoer5/ it.

But a large amount of this national security rhetoric feeds into extremist narratives about racist regimes closed to expression of religion. 

As stated by Wikipedia, a [dystopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia) (from the Greek δυσ- and τόπος, alternatively, cacotopia, kakotopia, or simply anti-utopia) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.

the long version
panopticon

This is one person's quest to understand the world we live in

This project's connection to the idea of the open web
this is not about non-proprietary web technologies, though it might create some. not about web standards, though could be about their security, understanding them and seeing how they can be turned against you
[Open Web](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/getting-to-know-mozilla-and-the-leadership-network/) can just be looked at as web standards, publishing and accessing content, but like the panopticon this soulless. Putting the open web in human context it's about: 

    Inclusion: an accessible, free Internet for all - who is being targeted, these are marginalised groups. If you're being targeted you aren't free to use the internet safely, also surveullance
    Privacy: user control of their own data on the web - if our data is being used to target us we don't have privacy, also surveillance
    [Web literacy](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/): the ability for everyone to meaningfully
        Read: navigate the web, and find, evaluate, and synthesize web content - need to know who is watching what you read, need a safe environment to explore, find the kind of information contained in these repos, critically assess them
        Write: code, design, compose, revise and remix content for the web - work on code, write analysis, fork our stuff, do stuff with with to change the world
        Participate: connect with online communities, share, contribute, maintain control over their own personal data, and work collaboratively with others on the web. - connect with security researchers and privacy advocates, if you want to use the internet safely these are the people you want to know.

Looking at this kind of stuff is a good primer to the wild west of the internet.
