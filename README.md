# Panopticon Project

## Welcome

## The problem

## The solution

## This is a terrible idea, you're helping terrorists!

And to that list you could add organised crime, hostile foreign governments, even your actual government if it isn't terribly sophisticated and doesn't already know this themselves. I would say firstly, this is a compilation of intelligence from publiclly avalable channels, at no point was any law broken. But the bigger point here is that there are plenty of entities that help terrorists, organised crime, governments etc., at a scale this database never could. One of them is gun manufacturers, and there are plenty others so you have bigger problems than P2.

To specifically address the point about terrorism, and this feeds into the wider debate about encryption and national security, it's true a terrorist could use P2 to assist them in comitting an act of violence. Again though, everthing in P2 is compiled from online sources so if P2 didn't exist that assistance was still there to be found, nothing new has been provided. The basic argument for privacy, and this comes back to terrorism, is curtains or blinds on your windows don't make you a criminal, it just means you want privacy. It's a part of human nature to want to express ourselves with no one, or those close, rather than an unchosen party or indeed the whole world. We need to be able to express ourselves and not all of humanity is pretty. That's not to say the ugly elements should be accepted, but sometimes people want to express them and its important they do in environments where there are a lot of moderate voices that through social mechanisms of a community dissuade the person from those ugly views. 

We've all held a view at some point in our lives that was repugnant to someone and what probably happened is we matured and grew out of it either by interacting with others and passively conclusing ourselves that view is socially unacceptable, examining why its unacceptable and internalising that conclusion, or being actively told "that's not cool!" I want disaffected youths to find encryption tools so they can find safe spaces, free of government surveillance, where they can express themselves and the community can fill those spaces with moderate voices. If encryption is cracked down upon these people are either 1. going to feel repressed because there is no safe space for them to express themselves and those ideas may not be moderated out through community interaction, or 2. they will go looking for safe spaces and if the moderate community can't provide one, hardened extremists will. Once one of these two things have happened radicalisation has started and its virtually game over because time and again we see police and intelligence agencies don't have the resources to investigate every name that comes across their desk. Figures differ but it's often quoted you need between ten and thirty people for round the clock surviellance of one target. Through sheer math some terrorist attacks will be successful. You need to prevent either 1 or 2 mentione above from happening.

Bottom line, Panopticon Project is actually a deradicalisation tool.

But a large amount of this national security rhetoric feeds into extremist narratives about racist regimes closed to expression of religion. 

As stated by Wikipedia, a [dystopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia) (from the Greek δυσ- and τόπος, alternatively, cacotopia, kakotopia, or simply anti-utopia) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.

This is one person's quest to understand the world we live in

This project's connection to the idea of the open web
this is not about non-proprietary web technologies, though it might create some. not about web standards, though could be about their security, understanding them and seeing how they can be turned against you
[Open Web](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/getting-to-know-mozilla-and-the-leadership-network/) can just be looked at as web standards, publishing and accessing content, but like the panopticon this soulless. Putting the open web in human context it's about: 

    Inclusion: an accessible, free Internet for all - who is being targeted, these are marginalised groups. If you're being targeted you aren't free to use the internet safely, also surveullance
    Privacy: user control of their own data on the web - if our data is being used to target us we don't have privacy, also surveillance
    [Web literacy](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/): the ability for everyone to meaningfully
        Read: navigate the web, and find, evaluate, and synthesize web content - need to know who is watching what you read, need a safe environment to explore, find the kind of information contained in these repos, critically assess them
        Write: code, design, compose, revise and remix content for the web - work on code, write analysis, fork our stuff, do stuff with with to change the world
        Participate: connect with online communities, share, contribute, maintain control over their own personal data, and work collaboratively with others on the web. - connect with security researchers and privacy advocates, if you want to use the internet safely these are the people you want to know.
        
Looking at this kind of stuff is a good primer to the wild west of the internet.
