## What is Panopticon Project?
P2 is an open database of open source intelligence (OSINT) covering the electronic capabilities of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), nation states, and corporations that exercise nation state capabilities. 

That was a lot of open source so let's break that down quickly. [Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) is anything that allows people to add to it, collaborate on it, take it, do their own thing with it. It's the opposite of [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary), which denotes ownership. We often see the terms open source and proprietary in relation to software, meaning software that anyone can add to the code base of, like Linux, and software you can't add to the code base of because it is under copyright, namely Windows and Mac. But as you can see, open source can also apply to things like troves information and even information gathering techniques. 

[OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) refers to the gathering of information in the public domain that anyone can do. You could also see P2 as [citizen journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_journalism). 

## Why does Panopticon Project exist?
P2 exists, in short, because the world has become a dystopia. As stated by Wikipedia, a [dystopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia) (from the Greek δυσ- and τόπος, alternatively, cacotopia, kakotopia, or simply anti-utopia) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.

State sponsored hackers are infiltrating critical infrastructure, so far having proven their ability to act on the real world by causing [blackouts](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine), among other things. Liberal Western democracies are the most intrusive [surveillance states](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/) in history. Corporations [collect vast amounts of information on their users](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/why-googles-spying-on-use_b_3530296.html) without their knowledge or consent. In the not too distant past this was science fiction, now it is reality. 

For many of us it is not a reality we chose or desire. Few understand how bad reality has gotten, and that suits those who have made the world the way it is just fine. However, there is a great deal of information lying in the public domain that can be used to learn about the powers behind our dystopia. By informing ourselves we can make informed decisions about how we interact with the world, from the political movements we interact with through to the services we use and the products we buy. By contributing to projects like P2, you can also learn how to better access information in the public domain and train yourself how to keep a critical eye on the powers that be. From checking facts to some [OSINT sleuthing of your own](http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/exclusive-indian-it-guru-linked-to-fake-wmc-sites-20170726), P2 empowers you to interact in a more informed manner with the world.

The long term vision for P2 is that people will be able to download the READMEs of repositories that refer to APTs, such as this [example](https://github.com/Panopticon-Project/panopticon-Gallmaker/blob/master/README.md) here, feed the contents to a network monitoring device to look for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and read the README for helpful advice on detecting the attacker and evicting them from the network. How the READMEs for nation states and corporations will be used, past general information, is still being determined. 

## I don't know much about these topics and need a primer
We have you [covered](https://github.com/Panopticon-Project/panopticon-primer).

## Who can contribute to P2?
Anyone with an internet connection and basic reading abilities.

## How can I get involved?
Check out our contributing guidelines.

## What does P2 need?
Eyes and time. For the most part we need people to look for news articles, declassified and leaked files now in the public domain, threat intelligence reports from cyber security companies, the list goes on. Then they need to be read and verified where possible. Anyone can contribute to this.

Those of you with visual arts abilities, we need a website and promotional material.

If you happen to have technical skills, even basic technical skills, there are more advanced ways for you to contribute. See our contributing guide for more details.

## I want to get in touch with P2
Email panopticonproject at protonmail dot com

## I want to leak something to P2
Seriously, just don't. This project is not equipped to handle leaked material not already in the public domain. Do your research and find a reputable news outlet that has a proven track record in handling leaked material in a responsible and safe manner.

## I still need to get in touch with P2 in a secure manner
Create a [ProtonMail](https://mail.protonmail.com) account if you don't already have one and email panopticonproject at protonmail dot com, emails over ProtonMail are end to end encrypted.

If encryption is your thing and you've got this, you don't need a ProtonMail account, check out our [public key](https://github.com/Panopticon-Project/panopticon-admin/blob/master/publickey.panopticonproject%40protonmail.com.txt)

Only incoming messages in inline OpenPGP format are currently supported.

## How do I start?
Make sure you have read through the [Contributing](https://github.com/Panopticon-Project/panopticon-admin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. Once you're up to speed, drop an email to panopticonproject at protonmail dot com
  
## There is one thing I'd ask of you
If you happen to find P2 useful, for whatever reason, even if just for the content that's provided to you, please share the project. Tell someone about it that might also find it useful, post on social media, spread the word however you want. Panopticon Project is designed to be open and accessible for all. If it's helped you in some way, please pay it forward.

## The connection between Panopticon Project and the idea of the Open Web
From Wikipedia, *The Open Web movement asserts a special role for public, cooperative, and standard World Wide Web communications; it opposes private, exclusive, proprietary Web solutions.* Strictly speaking it doesn't look like there is a lot P2 offers to the notion of the Open Web as P2 isn't concerned about private, exclusive or proprietary Web solutions (though its contributors might).

However, there is a [wider definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=169&v=tDDVAErOI5U) of the Open Web as defined by [Mozilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm5i5kbIXzc).

*"Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent."*

Currently internet users are not empowered, safe or independent as outlined under *Why does Panopticon Project exist?* above. Mozilla's take on this:

*"There are hidden interests. Monopolies. Silos. Surveillance. Fear. Insecurity. Public apathy, that are locking the right to imagine and shape what’s possible in the future of the Internet. This is why we are fuelling a worldwide movement. A movement of heroes to drive the next wave of open. [These are advocates, developers, makers, researchers, mentors, educators… leaders like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=130&v=LuyBGkbzTjs) who fight to protect and advance the open Internet in diverse ways."*

These are the five most pressing issues facing the Internet today according to Mozilla: 
* Online Privacy & Security - People understand and can meaningfully control how their data is collected and used online, and trust that it’s safe. In parallel, companies and governments work to protect our data and enhance our ownership over our digital identities.
* Open Innovation - Open is the default: open source and open standards continue to be at the heart of the Internet, and influence organisations and industries products, policies and practices. As a result, entrepreneurs and everyday Internet users can create, innovate and compete online without asking permission.
* Decentralisation - The technologies and platforms people use every day are interoperable and based on open standards. People expect and demand systems that allow seamless flow and transfer of information and content.
* Web Literacy - People have the skills to read, write and participate in the digital world. Together, these informed digital citizens move beyond just consuming content, to creating, shaping and defending the web.
* Digital Inclusion - People everywhere can access and have the opportunity to participate in building the entire Internet. Subsequently, everyone on the Internet has the opportunity to access and shape our digital world. The Internet reflects the diversity of the people who use it. 

And this is how P2 contributes to each of these points:
* Online Privacy & Security - P2 helps people understand how their data is collected and used online. It shows how [companies and governments](http://www.philly.com/philly/business/the-equifax-hack-has-the-hallmarks-of-state-sponsored-pros-20170929.html) in many cases don't work to protect their data. In fact, they either collect if without your permission, store it insecurely, deliberately monetise it and sell it, or steal it. P2 also shows people what they can do about it.
* Open Innovation - Open is the standard with P2. We're bringing what is usually only available in proprietary threat intelligence feeds to the masses and anyone can contribute
* Decentralisation - We're using open standards for creating the content of P2 so that others can perform the same work P2 does, either in conjunction with us or by doing their own thing. There is no central authority, this is just individuals sharing information
* Web Literacy - By contributing to P2 people learn the skills to read, write and participate in the digital world. From analysing the exploits of state sponsored hackers to simply applying critical reading skills to news stories, this project teaches and promotes web literacy
* Digital Inclusion - People everywhere can access and have the opportunity to participate in this project, which is one of the foundations of a healthy internet

Panopticon Project is training a movement of people to expose those who would do us harm online. By gathering information and disseminating it openly we can inform people about what's really going on in the world. People can make informed choices about how they interact with government and big business.

## I have objections to this project!
