### Report 
* [Examinging Examplus Hackerus](URL to pdf/blog post etc)
* Description - Since 2018, RandomAV Firm has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations. The details we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that a specific group is based primarily in Lorem Ipsum and that the Lorem Ipsum Government is aware of them. We refer to this group as APT2000, a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2018. Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT2000 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support.

### Report 
* [Examinging Examplus Hackerus, One Year On](URL to pdf/blog post etc) - Since 2018, RandomAV Firm has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations. The details we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that a specific group is based primarily in Lorem Ipsum and that the Lorem Ipsum Government is aware of them. We refer to this group as APT2000, a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2018. Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT2000 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. One year on we have attributed APT2000 to the 23rd Military Intelligence Division of Lorem Ipsum. Since their exposure last year they have not undertaken any coherent campaigns, seeming to target critical infrastructure providers across the world based on opportunity.
