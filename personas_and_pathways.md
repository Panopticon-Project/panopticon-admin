# Panopticon Project

## Personas and Pathways

Personas are a thought exercise in thinking about potential contributors and users to look at how they would engage with the project, helping to identify any barriers to entry and/or contribution so they can be removed. These personas where created as part of the [Mozilla Open Leadership Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and are completely fictitious. 

## Contribute

To ensure we have a diverse range of personas and pathways, people contributing to P2 are encouraged to create their own personas with complete pathways and add them here. Images should be taken from creative commons or be images you have rights to.

Use this rough formula to create your persona but feel free to add whatever you think is pertinent for the exercise.
* One sentence naming your persona and covering what they do for study, employment, etc.
* Two sentences listing some facts about our person to make them believable, covering things like family and pastimes.
* Three sentences explaining why they might want to use or contribute to P2, including reasons why they may be predisposed towards or against P2.

Use this formula to create your persona's pathway

* Discovery
* First Contact
* Participation
* Sustained Participation
* Networked Participation
* Leadership

The point of pathways is to identify barriers for entry into the community of contribution to the project, so feel free to list out identified barriers and if you like add possible suggestions around their removal.

### Carolina Mart√≠nez

![Security Researcher](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Sep/14/2001809618/1200/900/0/160824-M-PS017-857L.JPG)

Carolina Martinez is a security researcher from Colombia. She self taught herself programming when her parents bought her a barely running second hand computer for her tenth birthday, and she started competing in bug bounty programs at the age of fifteen to try and bring in extra money for the household. As she got older she started listening more and more to the discussions her parents had with aunts and uncles worrying about actions the government was taking against its populace in the name of cracking down on crime. Carolina came across P2 while studying recently released exploits to see if she could automate her own tools while bug hunting. She saw that a large part of P2 was about trying to inform people about the capabilities of governments and corporations, but she felt that contributing would one, draw unwanted attention to her and her family and two, take her away from bug hunting and bringing in a much required income.

### Pathway

* Discovery - Carolina found P2 while studying recently released exploits that she wanted to build into her penetration testing toolset
* First Contact - She contacts P2 to discuss the exploits further using a throwaway account from [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) to limit the chances of being identified
* Sustained Participation - Carolina speaks to people in the local information security community to get their thoughts on the project. She sees the usefulness such a resource so starts popularising it among people she trusts but is still a bit leery of contributing
* Networked Participation - Carolina finds P2 useful and thinks it could help others in the local information security community financially, by providing a a needed resource for people already in the field or looking to break in and land employment. She creates a GitHub account not tied to her identity and starts submitting things she comes across in her own work about tools and techniques not already included in P2
* Leadership - Carolina encourages others to participate in P2 to strengthen the grass roots information security community in Columbia. By contributing to a shared resource in the commons people in her community feel empowered to take control of their online presence for the betterment of public discourse against corruption and exploitation.

### Najja Odongo

![Journalist](http://maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com/static/photo/1x/Journalist-Mbale-Uganda-Cameraman-Media-Africa-2314796.jpg)

Najja Odongo is a journalist from Uganda. He is passionate about documenting human rights issues in his country and wants a safe and stable world for his wife and three children. Najja has no background in computer science but is starting to see through his work that he needs to have to understand the basics of principles like [operational security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security) and how governments conduct electronic surveillance. He's having trouble though as information online is so disparate. It's hard to tell what are the pros and cons of different things are like email services and communication apps, and with so much hearsay its near impossible to understand with any real certainty what governments and even corporations are and are not capable of. Najja is disillusioned by the lack of empirical evidence cited in information security, something anathema to the journalist in him, and doesn't know where to start.
