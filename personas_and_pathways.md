# Panopticon Project

## Personas and Pathways

Personas are a thought exercise in thinking about potential contributors and users to look at how they would engage with the project, helping to identify any barriers to entry and/or contribution so they can be removed. These personas where created as part of the [Mozilla Open Leadership Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and are completely fictitious. 

## Contribute

To ensure we have a diverse range of personas and pathways, people contributing to P2 are encouraged to create their own personas with complete pathways and add them here. Images should be taken from creative commons or be images you have rights to.

Use this rough formula to create your persona but feel free to add whatever you think is pertinent for the exercise.
* One sentence naming your persona and covering what they do for study, employment, etc.
* Two sentences listing some facts about our person to make them believable, covering things like family and pastimes.
* Three sentences explaining why they might want to use or contribute to P2, including reasons why they may be predisposed towards or against P2.

Use this formula to create your persona's pathway

* Discovery
* First Contact
* Participation
* Sustained Participation
* Networked Participation
* Leadership

The point of pathways is to identify barriers for entry into the community of contribution to the project, so feel free to list out identified barriers and if you like add possible suggestions around their removal.

### Carolina Mart√≠nez

![Security Researcher](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Sep/14/2001809618/1200/900/0/160824-M-PS017-857L.JPG)

Carolina Martinez is a security researcher from Colombia. She self taught herself programming when her parents bought her a barely running second hand computer for her tenth birthday, and she started competing in bug bounty programs at the age of fifteen to try and bring in extra money for the household. As she got older she started listening more and more the discussions her parents would have with aunts and uncles worrying about actions the government was taking against its populace in the name of cracking down on guerillas and drug traffickers. Carolina came across P2 while studying recently released exploits to see if she could automate her own tools while bug hunting. She saw that a large part of P2 was about trying to inform people about the capabilities of governments electronic capabilities of APTs, nation states, and corporations that exercise nation state capabilities, but she felt that contributing would one, draw unwanted attention to her and her family and two, take her away from bug hunting and bringing in a much required income.
