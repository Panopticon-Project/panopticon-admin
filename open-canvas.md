# Open Canvas for Panopticon Project (P2)

## Product

### Problem
* The world has become a dystopia.
* We understand the world is a dystopia, but few understand the dystopia itself.

### Solution
* Understand the dystopia so collectively we can make informed decisions about the world we live in.
* To understand the dystopia we need to research it and document it.

### Key Metrics
* Collect information on every APT
* Collect information on every government that exercises negative capabilities
* Collect information on every corporation that exercises negative government capabilities (surveillance, coercion, etc.) or sells capabilities to a government

### Project Execution - Resources Required

#### MVP
* Time to collect information
* Time to read the collected information

#### Panopticon 2.0
* Open source intelligence (OSINT) skills to monitor APTs, governments and corporations

## Community

### Project Execution - Contributor Profiles

* For 2.0, anyone with OSINT or technical skills for monitoring, intelligence analysis skills

### User Profiles

### Unique Value Proposition
* P2 offers a curated database that helps people understand the dystopic elements of the world we live in. If people can understand it they can repond in an informed way to it.
* P2 is different from everything out there as there is a lot of threat intelligence available, but it's almost universally closed source and narrow in focus. P2 is verifiable and contributing actually trains you to critically analyse the world around you.
