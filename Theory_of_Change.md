### Outcome map

### Assumptions about change

Below are the assumptions that were made as part of building the outcome map.

* That change is possible.
* That people desire change.
* That all people have an inalienable human right to privacy.
* That unchecked surveillance is wrong.
* That a check on surveillance that exists behind closed doors is wrong.
* That surveillance for profit is wrong.
* That activists have a right to be activists. People should be able to safely hold their government and others to account.
* That when nation states come after their citizens and others in invasive ways, they're scared of something. Scrutiny should be placed on them to evaluate why they are scared and hold the government of that nation to account.
* That an invasion of privacy is a harmful act in and of itself and it can lead to death.
* That surveillance is corrosive to society.
* That the discourse of power is continually being played out online.
* That if we turn a blind eye to the power wielded by some online we will end up with harmful nation states and corporations.
* That nation states and corporations are incentivised to harm people by gaining stability and money.
* That nation states and corporations will always tend to negative behaviour because of their incentives if left to their own devices.
* That due to their power, nation states and corporations are hard to change.
* That one of the few things that will make nation states and corporations change is public opinion.
