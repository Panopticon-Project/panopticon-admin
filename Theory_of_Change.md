# Panopticon Project

## Theory of Change

The Theory for Change written for Panopticon Project (P2) was written using the [Annie E. Casey Foundation's *Theory of Change: A Practical Tool For Action, Results and Learning*](https://www.aecf.org/resources/theory-of-change/). 

To restate what P2 is, P2 is an open database of open source intelligence (OSINT) covering the negative electronic capabilities of institutionalised malicious parties.

Negative electronic capabilities include, but is not limited to the below:
* [Espionage](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/world/europe/russia-hacker-evgeniy-bogachev.html) 
* [Sabotage](https://securityintelligence.com/the-full-shamoon-how-the-devastating-malware-was-inserted-into-networks/) 
* [Propaganda](https://www.rand.org/topics/information-operations.html)
* [Economic disruption](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)
* [Surveillance](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/). It is worth noting that while [surveillance itself is corrosive to society](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/the-surveillance-state-is-corrosive-the-case-of-pamela-jones/278846/), surveillance can be used to support physical operations that can include locating people for arrest or even [assassination](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-assassination-abroad-2017-6). 
* [Mass surveillance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/12/heres-everything-we-know-about-prism-to-date/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.536dabfd8d01), the surveilling of entire populations, rather than individuals or small groups. 
* [Use of artificial intelligence](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd)

Institutionalised malicious parties includes, but is not limited to the below:
* Advanced persistent threats, groups largely backed by nation states
* Nation states
* Corporations

### Outcome Map

#### Impact

##### Individual outcome areas and outcome statements

Outcome area | Outcome statement 
--- | --- 
Changes in attitudes | An increased view among individuals that institutionalised malicious parties can include but aren't limited to nation states and corporations. An increased view among individuals that institutionalised malicious parties have negative electronic capabilities. An increased view among individuals that institutionalised malicious parties use those capabilities to engage in negative online activities. An increased appreciation for the harmful effects of negative online activities that stem from negative electronic capabilities. A desire to learn about the negative online capabilities that institutionalised malicious parties choose to cultivate. A shift away from the "I have nothing to hide" mindset. A shift away from the national security mindset.
Changes in knowledge | An increased understanding of what negative electronic capabilities can be used for and how individuals and groups can be victimised through use of these capabilities.
Changes in awareness | An increased understanding how the activities stemming from negative online capabilities can impact the individual
Changes in skills | An increase in digital literacy. An increase in critical thinking. An increase in investigative abilities  
Changes in behaviour | Individuals practicing better OpSec (operational security). Individuals engaging in fact checking and open source investigations.

##### Population level outcome areas and outcome statements

Outcome area | Outcome statement 
--- | --- 
Changes in political discourse |  Negative electronic capabilities being an election issue
Changes in safety | Across society, digital literacy is improved. Groups are notified when they are being targeted. 
Changes in awareness | Society is aware of what institutionalised malicious parties are doing online

#### Influence

##### Outcome areas and outcome statements

Outcome area | Outcome statement 
--- | --- 
Changes in visibility of issue | Negative electronic capabilities are spoken about. Companies like banks, insurers, social media platforms and others are questioned about their use of data. Nation states are questioned on the negative electronic capabilities they cultivate. Media covers these issues accurately and more frequently. People pitch news stories
Changes in community norms | Society decreases tolerance for negative electronic capabilities. Society increases belief in its power to create change. 
Changes in partnerships | Partnerships are strategic. Collaborative relationships are built. Strategic partners jointly implement actions toward agreed-upon goals. Partnerships increase the ability to articulate a shared purpose. Partnership shares a plan of action. Partners increase referrals to one another. Partners increase sharing of resources. Partners increase seamless presentation to the public. Partners increase sharing of data. Partners use data to evaluate their efforts and refine strategies to achieve specific results.
Change in public will | Society is motivated to take action on an issue. Society decreases tolerance for negative electronic capabilities. Society increases their willingness to demonstrate around an issue. Consumers increase demand for improved services that don't exploit them.
Change in political will* | Political leaders increase their awareness of negative electronic capabilities. Political leaders increase their willingness to take action on issues. Legislators co-sponsor bills that support community priorities. Note* It's recognised that nation states are incentivised towards exercising negative online capabilities, so outcomes of political will are largely confined to non-nation state actors like corporations.
Change in policies | Specific policy changes. Policymakers draft legislation that reflects community priorities. Policymakers fund legislation that reflects community priorities.

#### Leverage

##### Outcome areas and outcome statements

Outcome area | Outcome statement 
--- | --- 
Changes in public funds | New public funds allocated toward privacy and security priorities. Public funds redistributed toward privacy and security priorities. New funding methods (pooled, matched, blended) increase monetary resources to support privacy and security priorities.
Changes in philanthropy | Increased funding available for privacy and security priorities. New funding methods (pooled, matched, blended) increase monetary resources to support privacy and security priorities. Foundation funding practices (RFP process, selection criteria) change to increase availability of funds for privacy and security priorities. Foundations make new types of funding available (e.g., PRI). Foundations previously uninvolved in privacy and security begin to provide funding for programs, agencies and initiatives.
Changes in resources available to respective communities | New physical resources (computer rooms, meeting rooms) are available to respective communities.

### Assumptions about Change

Below are the assumptions that were made as part of building the outcome map.

* That change is possible.
* That people desire change.
* That all people have an inalienable human right to privacy.
* That unchecked surveillance is wrong.
* That deliberately influencing people through any means other than factual two way discourse is wrong. 
* That censoring factual two way discourse is wrong. 
* That spreading lies is wrong.
* That spreading hate is wrong.
* That a check on surveillance that exists behind closed doors is wrong.
* That surveillance for profit is wrong.
* That activists have a right to be activists. People should be able to safely hold their government and others to account.
* That when nation states come after their citizens and others in invasive ways, they're scared of something. Scrutiny should be placed on them to evaluate why they are scared and hold the government of that nation to account.
* That an invasion of privacy is a harmful act in and of itself and it can lead to death.
* That surveillance is corrosive to society.
* That the discourse of power is continually being played out online.
* That if we turn a blind eye to the power wielded by some online we will end up with harmful nation states and corporations.
* That nation states and corporations are incentivised to harm people by gaining stability and money.
* That nation states and corporations will always tend to negative behaviour because of their incentives if left to their own devices.
* That due to their power, nation states and corporations are hard to change.
* That one of the few things that will make nation states and corporations change is public opinion.

Notes
Goal - less surveillance - panopticon is here for all but I may have to focus on a particular country
More scruity on surveillance
burn apts and/or make it harder to operate apts, the SIEM idea plays into this, something around actionable threat intelligence
raising awareness, raising technical literacy 

partnerships
journalists getting information to the people
outreach to schools
privacy activists across the world
office of the privacy commissioner?

Where I'm up to
work through so that chains
