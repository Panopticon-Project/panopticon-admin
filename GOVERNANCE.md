# Panopticon Project

## Governance

### Idylic state

Idealy, Panopticon Project (P2) could be run in a decentralised manner. All users would have an equal say and no one voice would dominate discourse. Centralised systems create a monoculture, meaning the project doesn't reach its full potential. It also introduces a sngle point of failure, or key person risk, by making the project dependant on one person or a small group of people for decision making, making the project fragile if the key person or people cannot perform their duties. 

### Reality

Decentralised organisations have their weaknesses. It can be hard to come to consensus, especially if consensus isn't clearly defined or agreed on, making the project fragile as it cannot make discisions and take action. Decentralisation can aslo render a project directionless as there is no agreed upon manner to work towards the shared vision, with individuals performing actions that pull the project in a number of drections at once.

There are also malicious parties to consider. Some will deliberately exploit the equality of a decentralised position to pursue a negative agenda, potentially connected to the groups detailed in P2 as weilding negative electronic capabilities, others connected to those groups, or others that fear they may be added to P2. Risks such as a malicious party gaining the trust of the community, achieiving a trusted position, and abusing that trusted position to cause harm to the project and its members must be considered.

### What the project strivest to be

P2 should be as decentralised as much as possible, and will always strive to run in a decentralised manner to ward off problems like monoculture and key people risk. This may not be achievable to the level that all would like though, which is an acknowledged problem.

### What we have

* Decisions for the project will be made by the project maintainer while the community of active contributors remains below ten people.
* As the community scales to ten active contributors and above, and the ten contribution pathways for co-maintainers will be made through training for select individuals.
* Select individuals will be chosen at the discretion of a maintainer and must pass a background check to assure the exisiting maintainers the selct individual is not a malicious party.
* Co-maintainer positions will be made available each time ten regular contributors come onbaord and stay onboard for a period of time at the discretion of the maintainers. 
* It is at the maintainers discretion what constitutes an active contributor.
* It is at the maintainer's discretion how long someone must contribute for them to be considered a contributor.
* If co-maintainers disagree
* add changing, adding and removing these rules
