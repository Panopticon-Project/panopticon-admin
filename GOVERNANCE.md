# Panopticon Project

## Governance

### Idyllic state

Ideally, Panopticon Project (P2) could be run in a decentralised manner. All users would have an equal say and no one voice would dominate discourse. Centralised systems create a monoculture, meaning the project doesn't reach its full potential. It also introduces a single point of failure, or key person risk, by making the project dependant on one person or a small group of people for decision making, making the project fragile if the key person or people cannot perform their duties. 

### Reality

Decentralised organisations have their weaknesses. It can be hard to come to consensus, especially if consensus isn't clearly defined or agreed on, making the project fragile as it cannot make decisions and take action. Decentralisation can also render a project directionless as there is no agreed upon manner to work towards the shared vision, with individuals performing actions that pull the project in a number of directions at once.

There are also malicious parties to consider. Some will deliberately exploit the equality of a decentralised position to pursue a negative agenda, potentially connected to the groups detailed in P2 as wielding negative electronic capabilities, others connected to those groups, or others that fear they may be added to P2. Risks such as a malicious party gaining the trust of the community, achieving a trusted position, and abusing that trusted position to cause harm to the project and its members must be considered.

### What the project strives to be

P2 should be as decentralised as much as possible, and will always strive to run in a decentralised manner to ward off problems like monoculture and key people risk. This may not be achievable to the level that all would like though, which is an acknowledged problem. As the project scales and receives funding the aspiration is to create a not for profit and operate in a manner similar to OWASP, but the timing of this is yet to be determined. 

### What we have until we reach not-for-profitdom

* The ranks of the project are lay contributor, regular contributor, co-maintainer (simply the maintainer until multiple maintainers join the project).
* It is the co-maintainers discretion what constitutes a regular contributor as oppose to a lay contributor. 
* Decisions for the project will be made by co-maintainers. Majority rules.
* Co-maintainers must meet regularly and can't take an action without voting.
* Administrator rights for the GitHub repository will only be granted on an as needs basis to adhere to the principle of least privileges. It's recognised this means that not all co-maintainers will have administrator rights.
* As the community scales and adds twenty regular contributors, pathways for co-maintainership will be made through training for select individuals.
* Select individuals will be chosen at the discretion of a co-maintainers and must pass a background check to assure the existing maintainers the select individual is not a malicious party.
* The execution of the background check will be through an OSINT search. Co-maintainers may decline to progress a select individual at any time. 
* If co-maintainers disagree they must vote. Majority rules. All co-maintainers will get a chance to speak.
* These rules can be amended by vote of co-maintainers.
